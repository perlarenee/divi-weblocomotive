This is a plugin with custom modules for the Elegant Themes Visual Builder, Divi. 

## Modules Included

### Masonry grid
> Inspired by https://codepen.io/iamsaief/pen/jObaoKo. I was looking for something that allowed for more control over grid items than the default divi masonry, and this met the need._

#### Features
* Section header field
* Flexible responsive masonry grid with grid items being added as seperate items within the module
* Optional overlay with adjustable background and text colors, title, description, and link/link behavior
* Option to either automatically sort grid as regular 1x1 grid or behave as a masonry grid
* Control of the grid column count on desktop/tablet and mobile device sizes
* Options to specify Desktop, Tablet and Mobile device sizes for each grid item
* Control of grid image background position left/right top/bottom


### Single Page Dot Navigation
#### Features
* Controls entirely through the module settings in the visual builder. No editing needed elsewhere
* Seperate navigation items added with complete control of target hash or external link, label, and link behavior
* Option to attatch to right or left of screen
* Option to show/hide label
* Option to hide the navigation until a scrolling action
* Option to hide the navigation when at the top of the page
* Option to show a logo or other image with or without a link above or below the dot navigation
* Some initial styling

### Infinite Loading Blog
#### Features
* Control of:
** Post Type
** Pseudo code styling
** Dark and light theme
** Amount of posts per 'page'
** Ascending or Descending Order of posts
** What posts sort by, date, title, modified, etc.
* Infinite load of posts without affecting the website footer. Load more button disappears after last post is loaded.
* Imitation subtitle using first cateogy name as subtitle. 


_Best of luck. I hope this helps._
